      <h2 id="GC">Grand Canyon</h2>
      <img src="images/GrandC1.jpg"/>
      <p>The trip started with a flight to Phoenix, Arizona and a shuttle 
        up to Flagstaff. Met up with the rest of my family and then on to the 
        South Rim of the Grand Canyon. We stayed in one of the Park's lodges 
        and did several hikes both along and down into the canyon.

      <p>Next stop was Page, Arizona. Home to Horseshoe Bend, Antelope Canyon,
        and the starting point for a raft trip down the Colorado River. Antelope
        Canyon is one of the more famous slot canyons that you've probably seen 
        in photographs.

      <h2 id="Mesa">Mesa Verde National Park</h2>
      <img src="images/MesaVerde1.jpg"/>
      <p>We dipped into Colorado for our third stop, Mesa Verde National Park
        which featured cliff dwellings over 700 years old. The above image shows 
        one of these dwellings known as Cliff Palace. We did a Park Ranger led 
        tour first thing in the morning, which is why there are no other tourists
        in that photo!

      <h2 id="Arches">Arches National Park</h2>
      <img src="images/Arches1.jpg"/>
      <p>Arches National Park was our first stop in the state of Utah near
        Moab. The appropriately named park features numerous naturally occuring
        stone arch formations.

      <h2 id="Bryce">Bryce Canyon National Park</h2>
      <img src="images/Bryce1.jpg"/>
      <p>We stayed in the state of Utah for our next stop. Without a doubt, 
        the most alien-looking of the parks we visited, Bryce was 20 degrees cooler
        than all the other stops on our trip. The signature feature of the park
        are the strange looking "hoodoos" shown in the above image.

      <h2 id="Zion">Zion National Park</h2>
      <img src="images/Zion.jpg"/>
      <p>Our last stop before heading home was Zion National Park. Of all the Parks
        we visited, Zion was the most majestic. Grand Canyon was massive to be sure, but 
        Zion had towering cliffs of its own and you just had the sense of being small 
        as you craned your neck staring up the faces of the cliff walls. My 
        favorite hike of the trip was here in Zion. Known as the Narrows, it was a trek 
        through the Virgin River flanked by high-as-you-can-see sheer cliff faces.
